        "question": "1. What is Disposable Temporary Email?",
        "answer": "Disposable Temporary Email is a free email service that allows users to receive emails at a temporary address for a specific period of time. It is also known as temp mail, fake email, burner mail, or bogus email addresses. The main purpose of this service is to protect users' real email addresses from spam, advertising emails, and malware, while also protecting personal privacy."
      },
      {
        "question": "2. How to use a temp mail generator to get an address?",
        "answer": "The process is very simple and usually does not require any registration: \nAuto-generate: Simply visit a website like TempAdd, and the system will automatically generate a temp mailing address for you. \nReady to use: You can copy this address generated by the generator directly and paste it into any third-party website or download page that requires email registration. \nReal-time receiving: All received emails will be displayed directly in the inbox on the webpage, where users can view the sender, subject, and content in real-time."
      },
      {
        "question": "3. Why do I need a Fake email or Burner mail?",
        "answer": "Using a temp mail generator has several core application scenarios: \nPrevent privacy leaks: Use a temporary address to hide your real identity when registering on untrusted websites, forums, or accessing public Wi-Fi. \nAvoid spam: Many websites send large amounts of marketing emails or sell data to third parties after obtaining your email. Using Burner mail keeps your primary inbox clean. \nDeveloper testing: Programmers and testers can generate multiple temporary addresses to verify application registration flows, verification code reception, and transactional email functions. \nGet offers and trials: Used to download free ebooks, get discount codes, or sign up for limited-time free trials on streaming platforms (like Netflix, Amazon Prime)."
      },
      {
        "question": "4. How long are these bogus email addresses valid?",
        "answer": "The lifespan of a temporary email is usually short, designed to meet short-term needs: \nValidity range: Depending on the service provider, the validity period can range from 10 minutes to several days. \nAuto-destruction: Once the preset time expires, the email address and all emails, personal IP addresses, and other information within it will be automatically and permanently deleted by the system."
      },
      {
        "question": "5. What are the security restrictions of using temporary emails?",
        "answer": "While temp mail is very convenient, please note the following restrictions:\nAttachments disabled: To protect users from viruses and malicious attacks, many services disable file attachments and only allow viewing text or HTML message. \nReceive only: Most temporary email services do not support sending emails. If you need to send anonymous letters, you typically need to use a dedicated alias service. \nStrictly prohibited for sensitive accounts: Never use temporary emails for bank accounts or long-term accounts storing important information. Since the address is temporary and domain rotation occurs, once lost, you will not be able to retrieve passwords or access accounts through that email."
