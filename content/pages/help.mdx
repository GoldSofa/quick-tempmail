# Help Center

Welcome to the TempAdd Help Center. Here you can find information on how to use our temporary email service and protect your privacy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How long is the temporary email valid?
The validity period depends on the specific service provider and user level. For free users, the address typically expires after **10 minutes**; for Premium users, the validity can be extended up to **1 hour**. Additionally, some services (like Tempmailo) may retain received emails for **2 days**, after which they are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

### 2. Can I send emails using the temporary address?
Most temporary email services are designed only to receive emails and **do not support sending**. If you need to send anonymous emails, you typically need to use a dedicated "free email alias" service.

### 3. Why can't I see email attachments?
To ensure security, many temporary email services disable file attachments and only allow the display of text or HTML messages. This measure is primarily to protect users from dangerous content, viruses, and malware.

### 4. How does it protect privacy and anonymity?
-   **No Registration Needed**: Using a temporary email does not require providing any personally identifiable information.
-   **Data Clearing**: After the email usage period ends, the system automatically clears personal details, IP addresses, and other traces.
-   **No Archives**: Service providers usually state that they do not read or store user email content, providing only a temporary receiving channel.

### 5. Why can't it be used for bank or important accounts?
**Warning**: Never use temporary emails for bank accounts or important information. Reasons include:
-   **Risk of Permanent Loss**: Temporary emails are short-lived, and providers periodically perform "domain rotation" to avoid blocking, which may prevent you from accessing the mailbox again for password resets.
-   **Security Risk**: In some cases, if you do not manually delete emails, unrelated users might accidentally see this information if addresses are recycled.

### 6. What if I haven't received an email?
Although emails are usually delivered instantly, if an expected email does not appear, you can click the **"Refresh"** button on the page. If the mailbox becomes unavailable due to timeout, the system will automatically generate a new email address.
